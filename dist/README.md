  ## OVERVIEW:
   A node.js README generator. This allows a quick construction of README files for any type of project. Both by prompting the user and automatically formatting the results, this makes for higher quality explanations of projects. In creating this, i found that by structuring the questions well, the consequential answers would be of higher quality..

  ## TABLE OF CONTENTS:

  [Usage](README.md#usage)

  [Tests](README.md#tests)
  
  [Credits](README.md#credits)

  ## Installation
  In order to install the program you will need node.js, the fs, the file saver that comes as part of node.js, as well as inquirer, an npm package that comes with a folder of dependencies. Once all of these are installed, the project itself will run. Two futher file structures should be installed from the root folder: a dist folder for the resulting READMEs and an assets/img/readme folder structure for sample images and copyright badges.

  ## Usage
  Prepare the images that you want to use and put them in the assets/img/readme folder where the badges are. Then run the program by typing node index. Follow the prompts, using full sentences, formatted as you would have them appear on the page. At image prompts, just enter the full name of the image files. Once the program is complete, and the README looks good, remember to copy depenant images, including the copyright badge that you selected into the same file stucture of the local project where you will put the finalized README. 

  ## Tests
  This has only been tested by me, though if others use it and have feedback, i would be happy to hear back about it.

  ## Credits
  Though i wrote this myself, nothing is ever done in a vacuum. This was done for a columbia coding course, so the writer of the course, the instructor and TAs, who helped and informed, as well as the writers of node, fs, inquirer and all of the dependencies all deserve thanks.
